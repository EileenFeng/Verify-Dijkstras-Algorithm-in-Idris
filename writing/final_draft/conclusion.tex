\section{Conclusion}
This thesis offers a verification for Dijkstra's algorithm with the Idris Programming Language \cite{idris}. Our contributions include a detailed mathematical proof on Dijkstra's correctness, a concrete algorithm implementation in Idris, and a verification program with a few incomplete proofs. In the verification process we have obtained many valuable experience and observations. Specifically, we observe a similarity between the mathematical proofs of lemmas and their corresponding Idris implementations, which indicates that with a dependently typed language, by providing precise function types, directly translation of mathematical proofs to verification programs can be a feasible approach. We also recognize a few design issues in our algorithm implementations, and some potential errors in Idris that are accountable for the incompleteness of our verification program, however we are confident to provide the complete implementation with more time granted.
