Program verification is the process of proving program correctness with formal, mathematical methods. In spite of the significance of validating program behaviors, program verification is seldom involved in software development and other real-life applications. This thesis offers a verification of Dijkstra's algorithm \cite{Dijkstras} implemented with the Idris Programming Language \cite{idris}, aiming to show how verification can be approached as a programming issue. We first provide a detailed mathematical correctness proof for Dijkstra's algorithm, including lemmas that are generally assumed by most proofs on Dijkstra's. We then offer demonstrations on the construct of our algorithm implementation and verification program. During this verification process, we notice a parallel between our mathematical proofs and the corresponding Idris implementations, which indicates that direct translation of clear, step-by-step mathematical proofs can be a feasible approach in program verification. We are also aware of certain incomplete proofs in our program, and recognize a few downsides of our design and potential errors in Idris that are partly accountable for this, however we are confident to provide the complete implementation with more time granted.
