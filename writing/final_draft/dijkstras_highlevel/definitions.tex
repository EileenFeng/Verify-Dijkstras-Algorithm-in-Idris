% Dijkstra's concept definition
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Definition}
Our implementation and correctness proof are based on the following definitions of key concepts used in Dijkstra's algorithm. 
\theoremstyle{definition}
\begin{definition}\textbf{Path}\\
\textit{(We adopt the definition of $path$ presented in the \texttt{Discrete Mathematics with Applications} book by \texttt{SUSANNA S. EPP} \cite{discrete}.)}
\\\\
A path from node $v$ to $w$ is a finite alternating sequence of adjacent vertices of G, which does not contain any repeated edge or vertex. A path from $v$ to $w$ has the form: 
\begin{center}
 $vv_0v_1....v_{n-1}w$ 
\end{center}
where each adjacent nodes $v_{i-1}, v_i$ has an edge from $v_{i-1}$ to $v_i$ in G. We denote the set of paths from $v$ to $w$ as $path(v, w)$.
\end{definition}
\tab
\begin{definition}\textbf{Prefix of Path}\\
Given a path from node $v$ to $w$ : $path(v, w) = vv_0v_1....v_{n-1}w$, the prefix of this $v-w$ path is defined as a subsequence of $path(v, w)$ that starts with $v$ and ends with some node $w' \in path(v, w)$ ($w'$ is a vertex in the sequence $path(v, w)$). 
\end{definition}
\tab
\begin{definition}\textbf{Length of Path} \\
The length of a path $p = vv_0v_1....v_{n-1}w$ is the sum of the weights of all edges in $p$. We write: 
\begin{center}
  $length(p) = \sum weight(v_{i-1}, v_i), \forall v_{i-1}, v_i \in p$ where $(v_{i-1}, v_i) \in G$. 
\end{center} 
\end{definition}
\tab
\begin{definition}\textbf{Shortest Path}\\
Denote $\Delta(s, v)$ as a shortest path from $s$ to $v$, and $\delta(v)$ as the length of $\Delta(s, v)$. $\Delta(s, v)$ must fulfills: 
\begin{center}
$\Delta(s, v) \in path(s, v)$ 
\\
and 
\\
$\forall p' \in path(s, v)$, $length(\Delta(s, v)) = \delta(v) \leq length(p')$
\end{center}
\end{definition}
