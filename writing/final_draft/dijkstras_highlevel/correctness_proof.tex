\subsection{Proof of Correctness} \label{mproof}
This section provides a mathematical proof for our Dijkstra's implementation, which includes proof of program termination and proof of correct program behavior.

\subsubsection{Lemmas} \label{lemmasM}
\tab\\
Denote $explored$ as the list of nodes in $g$ but not in $unexplored$, i.e., $explored$ stored all nodes whose neighbors have been updated by the algorithm. We index $explored$ by the number of iterations, such that $explored_i$ denotes the value of $explored$ at the beginning of the $i^{th}$ iteration.

\subsubsection{Proof of Termination} 
\begin{proof}{}
As the algorithm goes through each node in the graph exactly once when exploring one particular node, and as the size of the unexplored list decreases by one during each iterations, the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate. 
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Proof of Correctness}
\begin{proof}
By applying Lemma \ref{lemma4.5} to the last iteration, denote as $m^{th}$ iteration, of the algorithm, we obtained that for all nodes $n$ in the explored list, $dist_{m+1}[n]$ is indeed the shortest path distance value from source $s$ to $n$, hence Dijkstra's algorithm indeed calculates the shortest path distance value from the source $s$ to each node $n \in g$. 
\end{proof}
