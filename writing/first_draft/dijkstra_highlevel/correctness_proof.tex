\subsubsection{Proof of Correctness}
This section provides a theoretical proof for our Dijkstra's implementation, which includes proof of program termination and proof of correct program behavior.

\paragraph{Lemmas}
\tab\\
Denote $explored$ as the list of nodes in $g$ but not in $unexplored$, i.e., $explored$ stored all nodes whose neighbors have been updated by the algorithm. We index $explored$ by the number of iterations, such that $explored_i$ denotes the value of $explored$ at the beginning of the $i^{th}$ iteration.

\paragraph{Proof of Termination} 
\begin{proof}
The inner for loop is guaranteed to terminate as the algorithm goes through each adjacent node exactly once. As the size of list \texttt{unexplored} decreases by one during each iteration of the while loop, the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate. 
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Prove of Correctness}
\begin{proof}
By applying \texttt{Lemma 3.4} to the last iteration of the algorithm, we obtained that for all nodes $n$ in the explored list, $dist[n]$ is indeed the shortest path distance value from source $s$ to $n$, hence Dijkstra's algorithm indeed calculates the shortest path distance value from the source $s$ to each node $n \in g$. 
\end{proof}
