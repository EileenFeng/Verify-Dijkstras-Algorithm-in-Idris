### Verification of Dijkstra's Algorithm in Idris Language
This project provides the following: 
- An Idris implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
- An Idris program that verifies the correctness of the Dijkstra's implementation, which includes proof-programs that verifies the properties of every single data structures and functions used 
- A complete write-up that provides a detailed mathematical proofs that backs up the verification program, along with elaboration on the
